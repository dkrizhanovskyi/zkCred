# zkCred Proposal

## Motivation
Centralized credit scoring excludes billions and leaks data. On-chain scoring is fair but public. With zkCred, we merge decentralized finance with privacy-preserving ZK proofs to offer trustless, inclusive credit systems.

## Vision
- **Privacy**: Prove you’re creditworthy without revealing raw histories.
- **DeFi Integration**: Lenders incorporate zkCred scores to underwrite loans securely.
- **Inclusion**: Anyone with on-chain activity, not just traditional credit histories.

## Roadmap
1. Implement a minimal STARK proof-of-concept.
2. Integrate with a Starknet lending protocol.
3. Enhance scoring models, expand beyond single-chain data.

## Why Now?
Starknet’s ZK technology is maturing. The market demands under-collateralized lending. zkCred rides the bleeding edge of cryptography and DeFi.

## Summary
zkCred sets a new standard: no bullshit, privacy-first, and scalable. Check the specs for technical details.
